# GDB Baby Step 1

**Flag:** `picoCTF{549698}`

- opening the binary in gdb and seeing the assembly with 
`layout asm`
- At The End of the Function We can see in GDB that the value in hex 0x86342 is being transferred to 
eax register. 


![screenshot](assets/gdb_baby_steps.png)

- add a breakpoint at main function with `break main` 
- seen the screenshot `0x86342` is being transferred to `$eax`
- converting the value `0x86342` in decimal gives,  `549698`
- adding picoCTF{549698} to it gives the flag, 

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1.  Little bit of assembly and GDB
2.  how assembly is a topic of its own and needs a **LOT of time** 

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Compiling and running the binary
- setting break point on `main` and trying to print the variable.

# ARMssembly 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{e5c69cd8}`


How you approached the challenge:

- There could have been 2 main approches to solving this problem,
   - Reverse Engineer the assmebly,

   - Compile and run the assembly like a regular program, 

we are going to take the latter, because of our unfamiliarity with assembly. 

So reading the file, we have some key pieces of infomation:

```
.arch armv8-a
```
which means it is assembly for armv8.

- To compile it we need a "cross compiler" because i am currently on a x86-64 system. 
- we will also need a emulator to run the said binaries, which is qemu in this case. 

```
sudo apt install qemu-user-static && gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

- now we just compile and run, 
```
aarch64-linux-gnu-as -o chall.o chall.S
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o chall chall.o
```
compilation done now we run remember to install qemu or else it will not run. 

`./chall 3854998744 915131509 `

converting the output in hex, 

`0xe5c69cd8`

therefore our flag will be the part without '0x' 


What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Some basic Assembly for both x86 and arm
2. learned about gcc and the different compilers it offers. 
3. qemu emulation. 

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Tried to read the assembly ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
- spent quite a few hours trying to compile the assembly, (the world of compilers is vast)

# Vault Door 3

**Flag:** `picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_1fb380}`



- We have to simply Reverse the given Java File to find the password needed, which will give is the flag. 

- the following code will give the flag. 

```py

a = ['j', 'U', '5', 't', '_', 'a', '_', 's', 'n', 'a', '_', '3', 'l', 'p', 'm', '1', '8', 'g', 'b', '4', '1', '_', 'u', '_', '4', '_', 'm', 'f', 'r', '3', '4', '0']

b = ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*', '*']

count = 0
while (count<8):
    b[count] = a[count]
    count += 1

while count<16:
    b[23 - count] = a[count]
    count +=1


while count<32:
    b[46-count] = a[count]
    count += 2

count = 31

while count>=17:
    b[count] = a[count]
    count -= 2

# answer print Do not Touch
answer = ""
for j in b:
    answer += j


print("picoCTF{" + answer + "}")


```



What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Refreshed Python Indexing 
2. a little bit of Java
